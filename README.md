# IgElevators
IgElevators is a remarkable plugin that introduces the functionality of elevators with daylight sensors to the Minecraft world. This plugin revolutionizes vertical transportation by allowing players to build and use elevators in their Minecraft worlds.

One of IgElevators' outstanding features is its seamless integration with PlotSquared, a widely used plugin for managing and creating plots on Minecraft servers. When PlotSquared is combined with IgElevators, plot owners get enhanced control over elevator access rights. When an elevator is set to private, only the plot owner and members of that plot have the ability to teleport using the elevators.

This advanced feature of IgElevators, developed by the talented team at InterGuess, provides an unparalleled level of convenience and security. By restricting elevator use to property owners and property members in private properties, the plugin ensures that only authorized individuals have access to these vertical transportation systems.

With the implementation of IgElevators, Minecraft server administrators and players can enjoy a more immersive and efficient gaming experience. The plugin simplifies the process of traveling between different floors and levels, making building and exploring multi-story structures a breeze.
